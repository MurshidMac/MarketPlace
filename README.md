# MarketPlace
Project completed at Facebook University program

Marketplace is an easy way for college students to buy and sell items on their campus such as textboots, clothing and electronics. If you see an item that you are interested in, you simply click the Interested button to contact the owner and set up a time to meet and exchange the item.
